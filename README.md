# Java Multi-Project Starter

This is a starter repository for a Java project composed of multiples inter-related subprojects.
Each subproject can be developed and deployed autonomously, but they share fundamental common definitions.
Examples:
- Java Application with libraries
- Set of related Service Applications

The [Guidelines](./GUIDELINES.md) explain the structure of this repository, and has instructions on how to adapt it for your own project.

## Instructions

All common gradle actions are provided plus:
- Test coverage (JaCoCo).
- Documentation (javadoc).
- Publishing artifacts to local maven repository.

These actions can be applied for the whole project or for each individual subproject.

Have fun!
